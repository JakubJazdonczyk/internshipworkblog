Internship in Clinishare


On my internship I met great people and spent great time in a nice atmosphere. I was in Belfast and It was my first time abroad. Belfast is small but beautiful city with big past. I saw murals who presented the story of this place. Landscape also is beautiful, I never before see sea next to mountain, this is awesome.
I had internship in Clinishare. I learned a few new, useful things. Now I know how use Adobe Illustrator and Sketch 3 and keyboard shortcut for this programs. First I learned how do icon for mobile application in different styles and also I create my style. Later I try made infographic, that was something new for me and at start that was hard to do but with time I become better. Also a create some character who doesn’t look like stick-man, I think this is the best thing which I could learn here because to learn it I had to made up my style. I improve my design skills and that will be helpful in future. 
About my English I can tell this, it’s not better but I feel free to use it and don’t scare of mistakes. If I have a problem or don’t remember how to tell something, I try use another words. 
Work mate are great , I can talk with them about everything. They took me on bowling and this was so funny. People in Clinishare are really nice and helpful.
My time in Clinishare come to end but I’m happy to was there.
